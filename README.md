# ScootAR

An open-source Unity project based on the Coupled-Sim project and other assets.


## Licensing and Assets

All assets used in this project are either open source or have permissive licenses that allow redistribution.

This ensures the project remains fully distributable and reusable by other researchers.

## Research Use

This simulator was used in a VR user study evaluating:

- The effectiveness of AR navigation lines
- Pedestrian proximity warning systems
- The influence of pedestrian density on driving behavior
- Comparison of smartphone-based vs AR-based navigation

The environment and scripts can be reused or modified to suit other experimental setups.
